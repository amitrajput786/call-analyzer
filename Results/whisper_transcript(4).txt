 This affects within our own societies and countries who speak English as a first language or at first language level because it affects people who have a particular type of dialect or vernacular that they use in their own communities. My own original dialect of English, for example, is seen as a low-class variant of English. If I were to speak it to people, I might have to give her a job interview. I would be perceived very differently to how I'm perceived now, speaking standard northern English. Similar things happen in the US with African-American vernacular English where it will be perceived differently in different contexts. There are many, many different elements that come into this, the intersec between native speakers, speakers as a second language. People who are native level speakers with other community language and then they go through an English language education system and therefore have the native level ability. So there are so many layers to that idea that it becomes quite complicated. And I think possibly the people that fit into that category actually, the last one that I mentioned, you have a community language or a family language and you learn English because you go through the system and you speak it at school, you speak it outside, you speak to a native level, when they try and go out abroad because they speak a local language too, they even find it very difficult. I imagine sometimes even start doubting themselves and it's like, logically, there is an issue to overcome that. Yeah, that's just my thoughts on what I've heard. Nice, thank you. Will sit. Thank you. Thank you very much. Anything to add? Guys, please, take your Fiona, please go ahead. I have loads to say though, so I'm happy to wait for someone else to jump in. Yeah, I'd love to hear your point. I just want to, is there like a stop? I don't hate this non-native. Is there anyone else? Because I just, it seems as though the point I'm full, the native, sure, and I like that. So feel free. Of course. Must stop. Okay, I will ask a question. Today, I saw a post on Facebook saying, there are, I think, eight sounds. If you say them correctly in English, you're going to sound exactly like native speakers, but actually, I didn't believe it because I think there is something called phonotechs. We have to be perfect at it. Yeah, and they have a question about phonotechs. It is that important to study phonotechs to be able to speak correctly or not for that. Actually, I'm studying this subject at university, and they just, the professors at university just teach us how to write a sentence in phonotechs way. Transcription, I think we call it. I don't know. I have forgotten actually. And so I just, when I know it's important to study phonotechs writing on, in order, is that helpful to improve your speaking? All it has nothing to do with speaking, just for writing. Who's going to answer? I can answer that if you want. Please, please, go ahead. So, I think in terms of, you mean like IPA, right? There's symbols to write down the sounds. I personally, I don't think it's necessary, but I do think it's really interesting. It's and quite a nice thing to use. I think, I think, the language between them is especially deep-thongs. I found them very difficult for me to distinguish between how well can I use this or that? Okay. So, I found them difficult for me. It's, I mean, the thing is nowadays, I think maybe they were more relevant before you could literally hear the pronunciation. You could just go online and press the little speaker on Google and hear the word that you want to hear. Yeah, I don't know if that. I personally, I don't think they're that relevant for teaching. And I think if I were teaching a student from scratch, maybe a young learner, maybe I would teach the symbols. But I don't think there's any reason to like stress about learning them. No, but they are fun. So, you think there is no need to learn them, right? Because some people who speak a great good way, but they didn't know them at all. Okay, they don't know them at all, but I am learning them, but maybe I am not sound like others, they are maybe a lot of people who speak better than me, but they didn't learn them. I am learning them, but I feel like there is no need for them. There is no beneficial stuff of learning them. Yeah, I mean, you mentioned you're studying at university, right? You're studying this as part of your degrees, that right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I mean, I guess, yeah, in that case, you need to learn them, but just to pass the test or whatever.
